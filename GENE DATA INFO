Objective: The goal of this code is to create a small database table that stores information about human genes and their related diseases (phenotypes). 
           It sets up a structure for organizing gene data and then adds some real examples (like BRCA1, TP53, and CFTR).
           

The purpose of this code is to:

- To create a structured database table for storing gene information.

- To organize details such as gene symbols, OMIM IDs, phenotypes, and descriptions.

- To make it easier to search genes quickly by adding indexes on gene symbol and OMIM ID.

- To insert example data of well-known genes (BRCA1, TP53, CFTR) and their associated diseases.

- To provide a foundation for research, analysis, or medical applications involving geneâ€“disease relationships.
