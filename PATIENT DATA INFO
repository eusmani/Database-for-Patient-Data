Objective: To create a database that keeps patient clinical information and genetic data organized in one place. It connects details about patients, genes, variants, 
and structural variants, while also including phenotype and ortholog data. This makes record-keeping more accurate, data easier to access, and helps with research on how genes relate 
to patient health.


The purpose of this code is to...

- To create a database structure for storing genetic and clinical data.

- To record patient information including demographics, HPO terms, and notes.

- To store detailed gene information such as descriptions, pLI scores, and OMIM disease associations.

- To capture genetic variants with annotations like HGVS notation, ClinVar significance, review status, and allele frequency.

- To link patients to their variants and describe inheritance patterns and phenotype notes.
